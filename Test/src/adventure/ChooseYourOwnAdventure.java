 * This class is a command line interface to play through some CYOA stories.  Stories are Java classes that extend Story, 
 * and are hardcoded into the stories array.  This is the conceptually simpler way to work with CYOA, but is not
 * as user friendly or extendible (no CSV file loading, for instance) as the Swing GUI version (ChooseYourAdventureFrame).
